# Part 1: Data Preparation

Input data and merge two data by year and month.

```{r}
price <- read.csv("C:/Users/Chuyu/Desktop/price_new.csv", header = T, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = F)
Macro <- read.csv("C:/Users/Chuyu/Desktop/Macroscopic.csv", header = T, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = F)

#Data type conversion
price$Cid <- as.character(price$Cid)
price$buildingType <- as.factor(price$buildingType)
price$renovationCondition <- as.factor(price$renovationCondition)
price$buildingStructure <- as.factor(price$buildingStructure)
price$district <- as.factor(price$district)

# merge data
price$tradeTime <- as.Date(price$tradeTime)
Macro$Date <- as.Date(Macro$Date)
price$tradeMonth <- format(price$tradeTime, "%Y-%m") 
Macro$month <- format(Macro$Date, "%Y-%m") 
price2 <- merge(price, Macro, all.x = T, by.x = "tradeMonth", by.y = "month")

# Delete irrelevant variables
price2 <- price2[,-c(1,26)]
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
